# Electronic desnsity of states (DOS)-prediction using linear regression model
In this project, we first calculate the valence electron concentration (VEC) of alloys based on their compositions. Next, we compute the $E_{VRH}$ values using the rule of mixtures. A `linear regression` model is then trained using two features to predict the density of states (DOS), based on our DFT-derived dataset.
This work was utilized in the paper published in `Materials & Design`. You can access the paper here:

Furthermore, we are developing a new ml model with additional features to improve prediction accuracy in DOS.
