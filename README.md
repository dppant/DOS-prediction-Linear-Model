# DOS-prediction using linear regression model
In this project, first, we calculate valence eletron concentration of alloys based on thier alloy composition. Then, we calcualte E-VRH usign rule of mixture. We trained a linear regresssion model using only 2 features. Then using a trained `linear regresstion model` (trained on our DFT data), we predict DOS. We are training a new model with more features to increase the accurary in the prediction.
