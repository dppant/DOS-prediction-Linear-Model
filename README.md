# DOS-prediction using linear regression model
In this project, we first calculate the valence electron concentration (VEC) of alloys based on their compositions. Next, we compute the $E_{VRH}$ values using the rule of mixtures. A `linear regression` model is then trained using two features to predict the density of states (DOS), based on our DFT-derived dataset. Finally, we are developing a `new model` with additional features to improve prediction accuracy.
